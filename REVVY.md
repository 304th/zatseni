## Competitive Strategy Against Revvy

### Primary Attack Vector: Reliability

**Message:** "SMS работает. WhatsApp — нет."

Revvy's WhatsApp dependency is their Achilles heel. With WhatsApp blocked in Russia:
- Their messages don't get delivered
- Customers don't receive review requests
- ROI drops significantly

**Otzovik's pitch:** "Your customers will actually receive the message."

### Secondary Attack Vector: Price

| Comparison | Savings |
|------------|---------|
| Otzovik Старт vs Revvy Стандарт | 2,800₽/mo (70% less) |
| Annual savings | 33,600₽/year |

**Otzovik's pitch:** "Same results, 70% cheaper."

### Tertiary Attack Vector: Simplicity

Revvy has many features (broadcasts, upselling, client exchange) that small businesses don't need.

**Otzovik's pitch:** "Just reviews. Nothing else to learn."

## What Otzovik Should Copy from Revvy

| Feature | Priority | Effort | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Rating widget for website | High | Low | Increases visibility |
| Telegram channel | Medium | Medium | Backup to SMS |
| More review platforms (Zoon, Flamp) | Low | Medium | Nice to have |
| Partner/agency program | High | Low | Distribution |
| Case studies with numbers | High | Low | Trust building |

---

## What Otzovik Should NOT Copy

| Feature | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| WhatsApp integration | Blocked, wasted effort |
| Marketing broadcasts | Scope creep, different product |
| Upselling tools | Complexity, not core value |
| Client exchange | Confusing, low value |
| Dedicated manager | Expensive, doesn't scale |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Revvy is vulnerable.** WhatsApp block is a real problem they can't easily fix.

2. **Market is validated.** 143M₽/year proves demand exists.

3. **Price is elastic.** Revvy charges 3-5k₽, Otzovik can win at 1-2k₽.

4. **Features aren't everything.** SMS reliability > feature count.

5. **Speed matters.** Window of opportunity while WhatsApp is blocked.
