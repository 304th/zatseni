## Tier 1: Most Promising

### 1. AI Meeting Assistant ★★★★☆

**What:** Transcription + summarization + action items for video calls

**Why now:**
- Otter.ai, Fireflies = English-focused, may have payment issues
- Remote work normalized → more meetings
- GPT-4 makes summarization excellent
- Russian language = differentiation

**Competition:**
- No strong Russian player
- Global: Otter ($17M ARR), Fireflies, Fathom, Grain

**Pricing model:**
| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | 0₽ | 5 meetings/mo, basic summary |
| Pro | 990₽/mo | Unlimited, full transcript, integrations |
| Team | 2,490₽/mo | Shared workspace, analytics |
| Enterprise | Custom | SSO, API, on-prem |

**Market size:** Every company with remote meetings → huge TAM

**Technical challenges:**
- Russian ASR (speech recognition) quality
- Real-time processing
- Integrations (Zoom, Meet, Teams, TrueConf)

**Unit economics (estimate):**
- ARPU: 1,500₽/mo
- Gross margin: 60% (ASR APIs expensive)
- CAC: 5,000₽
- LTV:CAC: ~5:1 ✅

**Verdict:** Strong opportunity. AI-native product, clear pain point, low competition in Russia. Main challenge: ASR quality for Russian.

### 2. Subscription Billing Platform ★★★★☆

**What:** Billing infrastructure for SaaS companies — subscriptions, invoicing, revenue recognition

**Why now:**
- Stripe Billing not available in Russia
- Chargebee, Recurly = western, payment issues
- Russian SaaS market growing 25%+ YoY
- LBX, PayOnTime exist but limited

**Problem:**
> "90% of B2B SaaS companies in Russia issue invoices manually or spent >1M₽ to build billing"

**Competition:**

| Player | Focus | Weakness |
|--------|-------|----------|
| LBX Billing | SaaS billing | Small, limited integrations |
| PayOnTime | B2B invoicing | Legacy, basic |
| ЮKassa | Payments | Not billing, just payments |
| Manual + 1C | Most companies | Painful, doesn't scale |

**Pricing model:**
| Tier | Price | Revenue processed |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Startup | 4,990₽/mo | Up to 1M₽/mo |
| Growth | 14,990₽/mo | Up to 10M₽/mo |
| Scale | 29,990₽/mo | Up to 50M₽/mo |
| Enterprise | 0.5% of revenue | Unlimited |

**Features:**
- Subscription management
- Multiple pricing models (per-seat, usage, hybrid)
- Invoicing in Russian format
- Integration with 1C, banks
- Revenue recognition
- Dunning (failed payment recovery)
- Customer portal

**Market:**
- ~5,000 Russian SaaS companies
- Average needs billing help
- TAM: 500M₽+/year

**Verdict:** Underserved market, infrastructure play. If executed well, becomes very sticky (switching cost high).

---

### 3. AI Voice Agents ★★★☆☆

**What:** AI-powered phone agents for inbound/outbound calls

**Why now:**
- Labor shortage in Russia: 4.8M people (2023)
- Call center costs rising
- Voice AI quality improved dramatically (GPT-4, ElevenLabs)
- 85%+ accuracy in intent recognition achievable

**Market (Russia):**
- Top players revenue: 1.2B₽+ (2023)
- Leaders: BSS (523M₽), Robin, AutoFAQ, Tomoru

**Competition:** Crowded but fragmented

| Player | Revenue | Focus |
|--------|---------|-------|
| BSS | 523M₽ | Enterprise banking |
| Tomoru | — | SMB-friendly |
| Just AI | — | Enterprise |
| RoboVoice | — | SMB |
| Exolve | — | Telecom |

**Differentiation opportunities:**
1. **Vertical focus** — healthcare appointments, real estate, HR
2. **Better AI** — GPT-4 based, more natural
3. **Self-serve** — no-code bot builder
4. **Pricing** — per-call vs per-seat

**Challenges:**
- Telephony infrastructure complex
- Enterprise sales needed
- High capital requirements

**Verdict:** Big market but competitive. Need strong differentiation or vertical focus.

---

## Tier 2: Interesting Opportunities

### 4. Carbon/ESG Reporting ★★★☆☆

**What:** Software for tracking carbon emissions and ESG compliance

**Why now:**
- Since Jan 1, 2024: companies >50k tons CO2/year must report
- EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment) starting 2026
- ESG disclosure recommendations for companies >10B₽ revenue
- No strong Russian player

**Target customers:**
- Exporters to EU (CBAM compliance)
- Large companies (>10B₽ revenue)
- Manufacturing, energy, mining

**Challenges:**
- Niche market (maybe 1-2k companies)
- Long sales cycle
- Need domain expertise
- Regulatory uncertainty

**Verdict:** Regulatory tailwind but narrow market. Good if you have industry expertise.

---

### 5. Proposal/CPQ Software ★★★☆☆

**What:** Create, send, track sales proposals with e-signatures

**Why now:**
- PandaDoc, Proposify = western, payment issues
- No strong Russian CPQ alternative
- Sales teams still use Word + Email

**Competition:**
- No clear Russian leader
- Some use Bitrix24 (basic)

**Pricing:**
| Tier | Price |
|------|-------|
| Starter | 1,990₽/mo |
| Pro | 4,990₽/mo |
| Enterprise | 14,990₽/mo |

**Features:**
- Template library
- E-signature (integrate with Контур.Подпись)
- Analytics (opens, time spent)
- CRM integrations (Bitrix24, amoCRM)
- Payment integration

**Market:** Every B2B sales team = large TAM

**Verdict:** Clear gap but not urgent pain. Nice-to-have vs must-have.

---

### 6. Internal Tools Builder (Retool Alternative) ★★★☆☆

**What:** Low-code platform to build admin panels, dashboards, internal apps

**Why now:**
- Retool = $50+/user/month, payment issues
- Every company needs internal tools
- Open source exists (Appsmith, ToolJet) but needs hosting

**Competition:**
- Open source: Appsmith, Budibase, ToolJet
- No Russian commercial SaaS

**Opportunity:**
- Hosted Russian Appsmith/ToolJet
- Local support, ruble pricing
- Compliance (data in Russia)

**Challenges:**
- Open source is free
- Need to add significant value over self-hosted
- Technical product, developer audience

**Verdict:** Opportunity exists but need clear differentiation from free open-source.

---

## Tier 3: Avoid or Niche Only

### 7. Workflow Automation (Zapier) ★★★☆☆

**Competition too strong:**
- Albato — Russian, funded (1M+ investment)
- ApiX-Drive — supports Russian services
- n8n — open source, self-hosted
- Make — works in Russia

**Verdict:** Market exists but competitive. Albato already doing this.

---

### 8. Appointment Scheduling (Calendly) ★★☆☆☆

**Too competitive:**
- Calink — free Russian alternative
- DIKIDI — established, multi-functional
- HESUS — embeddable widget
- Many niche players

**Verdict:** Commoditized. Only viable with strong vertical focus (e.g., medical only).

---

### 9. Email Marketing ★☆☆☆☆

**Why NOT:**
- SendPulse — Russian-friendly, strong
- DashaMail — Russian
- GetResponse, Mailchimp — still work
- Commoditized, race to bottom

**Verdict:** Don't do this. Overcrowded.

---

### 10. Developer Documentation ★★☆☆☆

**Why cautious:**
- GitBook, ReadMe still work
- Open source: Docusaurus, MkDocs free
- Small market (only dev-focused companies)
- Low WTP

**Verdict:** Niche. Only if bundled with API management or developer portal.
