# Otzovik.ai — Business Prospects & Growth Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** Viable lifestyle business, not a VC-scale startup.

**Realistic outcome:** 1-3M₽/year profit, sellable for 10-30M₽ in 2-3 years.

**Ceiling with expansion:** 5-10M₽ MRR (60-120M₽ ARR), exit at 150-300M₽.

---

## 1. Is It Viable?

### Why It Works

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Real pain** | Businesses care about ratings, will pay to improve |
| **Proven model** | Revvy does 50-100M₽/year (estimated) |
| **WhatsApp block** | Genuine competitive advantage in Russia |
| **Low CAC market** | Local businesses actively search for solutions |
| **Recurring revenue** | SaaS model, sticky once integrated with CRM |

### Why It's Limited

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Small TAM** | ~50k potential customers in Russia who'd pay |
| **Low ARPU** | Avg 3-4k₽/month, not 30-40k₽ |
| **Commoditized** | Easy to copy, no real moat |
| **Churn risk** | Small businesses close, switch, or "graduate" |
| **SMS margins thin** | 40-50% goes to SMS costs |

---

## 2. Realistic Projections

### Revenue Scenarios

| Scenario | 12 months | 24 months | Monthly Profit |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Pessimistic** | 50 customers | 100 customers | 50-100k₽ |
| **Realistic** | 150 customers | 400 customers | 150-300k₽ |
| **Optimistic** | 300 customers | 800 customers | 400-700k₽ |

### Realistic Year 1 Breakdown

```
150 customers × 3,000₽ avg = 450k₽ MRR
Annual revenue: 5.4M₽
Gross margin (50%): 2.7M₽
Marketing (100k/mo): 1.2M₽
Net profit: ~1.5M₽/year (~125k₽/month)
```

### Comparison with Alternatives

| Path | Year 1 Profit | Effort | Risk |
|------|---------------|--------|------|
| **This app** | 1-2M₽ | High | Medium |
| **Freelance dev** | 2-4M₽ | Medium | Low |
| **Job (senior)** | 3-5M₽ | Low | Very low |

---

## 3. Should You Pursue?

### Yes, if:

- You want to learn SaaS end-to-end
- You're okay with 100-300k₽/month as success
- You enjoy marketing/sales, not just coding
- It's a side project while employed

### No, if:

- You need 500k₽+/month to survive
- You hate sales/marketing
- You want VC-scale outcome
- You're quitting job to do this full-time with no runway

## 4. Growth Strategies

### Overview

| Strategy | Potential Impact | Effort | Timeline |
|----------|------------------|--------|----------|
| CIS Expansion | +2-4M₽ MRR | Medium | 2-3 mo/country |
| White-label | +500k-1M₽ MRR | High | 2-4 months |
| Review Monitoring + AI | +50-60% ARPU | High | 3-6 months |
| Vertical Focus | +30-50% ARPU | Medium | 1-2 mo/vertical |

---

## 5. Strategy 1: CIS Expansion

### Market Opportunity

| Country | Population | Businesses | Review Platforms | Payment |
|---------|------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Kazakhstan** | 20M | ~200k SMBs | 2GIS, Yandex, Google | Kaspi, YooKassa |
| **Belarus** | 9M | ~100k SMBs | Yandex, Google | ЮMoney, local banks |
| **Uzbekistan** | 35M | ~300k SMBs | Google, Yandex growing | Payme, Click |
| **Kyrgyzstan** | 7M | ~50k SMBs | 2GIS, Google | Local banks |
| **Armenia** | 3M | ~30k SMBs | Google, Yandex | Local cards |

### Why It Works

- **Same language** — Russian UI works in all CIS
- **Same platforms** — 2GIS and Yandex Maps operate there
- **Less competition** — Revvy is Russia-focused
- **SMS works** — no WhatsApp dependency issue

### Implementation

```
Effort: Medium
Timeline: 2-3 months per country

Tasks:
- Add local SMS provider (each country has own)
- Add local payment gateway
- Localize landing page (minor tweaks)
- Local SEO / ads
```

### Economics

| Market | Potential Customers | ARPU (lower) | Added MRR |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Kazakhstan | 500-1000 | 2,000₽ | 1-2M₽ |
| Belarus | 200-400 | 2,000₽ | 400-800k₽ |
| Uzbekistan | 300-600 | 1,500₽ | 450-900k₽ |
| **Total** | | | **+2-4M₽ MRR** |

### Risks

- Payment collection harder (currency, chargebacks)
- Support in local context
- SMS costs vary wildly
- Smaller markets = slower growth

---

## 6. Strategy 2: White-Label for Agencies

### Opportunity

Marketing agencies manage 10-100 local business clients each. They need tools to offer as "their own service."

**Target:** Digital agencies, marketing freelancers, franchise consultants

### Business Model

```
Agency pays you: 30,000₽/month (flat)
Agency charges clients: 3,000₽/month × 20 clients = 60,000₽
Agency profit: 30,000₽
Your revenue: 30,000₽ (one customer, no support burden)
```

### Implementation

```
Effort: High
Timeline: 2-4 months

Features needed:
- Custom domain (reviews.agencyname.ru)
- Agency dashboard (manage multiple businesses)
- Remove Otzovik.ai branding
- Agency billing (one invoice, not per-client)
- Bulk SMS pricing (lower cost at volume)
```

### Pricing Model

| Plan | Businesses | Price | Your Cost | Margin |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Agency 10 | Up to 10 | 15,000₽/mo | 5,000₽ | 67% |
| Agency 25 | Up to 25 | 30,000₽/mo | 10,000₽ | 67% |
| Agency 50 | Up to 50 | 50,000₽/mo | 18,000₽ | 64% |
| Agency 100 | Up to 100 | 80,000₽/mo | 30,000₽ | 62% |

### Economics

```
20 agencies × 30,000₽ avg = 600,000₽ MRR

Comparison:
- 20 agency customers vs 600 direct (support load)
- Higher retention (agencies sticky)
- Agencies do marketing for you
- Predictable bulk SMS costs

Target: 500k-1M₽ MRR from 20-30 agencies
```

### Risks

- Longer sales cycle (need demos, calls)
- Agencies demand features, customization
- If agency churns, lose 20+ businesses at once
- Need actual sales process, not self-serve

---

## 7. Strategy 3: Review Monitoring + AI Responses

### Opportunity

Current product only **generates** reviews. Full reputation management includes:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Monitor** | See all new reviews across platforms |
| **Alert** | Notify when negative review appears |
| **Respond** | AI-drafted replies to reviews |
| **Analyze** | Sentiment trends, competitor comparison |

### Value Proposition Shift

```
Current: "Get more reviews" — one-time value, churn after rating improves
Expanded: "Manage your reputation" — ongoing value, lower churn
```

### Implementation

```
Effort: High
Timeline: 3-6 months

Components:

1. Review scraping (already built for matching!)
   - Run daily, not just after clicks
   - Store all reviews, not just matched

2. Dashboard
   - All reviews in one place
   - Filter by platform, rating, date
   - Reply directly (if platforms allow)

3. AI Response Generator
   - Input: review text + business context
   - Output: professional response draft
   - Human approves before posting

4. Alerts
   - Telegram/email when new review appears
   - Urgent alert for 1-2 star reviews
```

### Pricing Impact

| Tier | Current | With Monitoring | Increase |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Старт | 1,190₽ | 1,990₽ | +67% |
| Бизнес | 4,990₽ | 7,990₽ | +60% |
| Сеть | 16,990₽ | 24,990₽ | +47% |

### Economics

```
Current: 300 customers × 3,500₽ = 1.05M₽ MRR
With monitoring: 300 customers × 5,500₽ = 1.65M₽ MRR

Extra 600k₽/month, minimal extra cost (scraping is cheap)
```

### Implementation Priority

| Feature | Effort | Value | When |
|---------|--------|-------|------|
| Review monitoring | Medium | High | After 100 customers |
| Alerts (Telegram) | Low | High | After 100 customers |
| AI responses | Medium | Medium | After 200 customers |
| Competitor tracking | High | Low | After 500 customers |

### Risks

- Scraping can break (Yandex/2GIS change HTML)
- AI responses need human review (brand risk)
- Feature creep — more complex product

---

## 8. Strategy 4: Vertical Focus (Niche Down)

### Opportunity

Instead of "reviews for all businesses," become:

- "Review tool for dental clinics"
- "Review tool for auto services"
- "Review tool for beauty salons"

### Why Niching Works

| Generic | Vertical |
|---------|----------|
| "Collect reviews" | "Collect reviews + ProDoctorov + NaPopravku for clinics" |
| Compete on price | Compete on fit |
| 3,000₽/month | 8,000₽/month (specialists pay more) |
| Self-serve | High-touch sales OK |
| No community | Industry conferences, associations |

### Best Verticals

| Vertical | Why | Added Platforms | Pricing Power |
|----------|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| **Dental/Medical** | High ticket, reviews critical | ProDoctorov, NaPopravku | 2-3x |
| **Auto services** | Loyal customers, trust matters | Auto.ru reviews | 1.5-2x |
| **HoReCa** | Already use iiko/Poster | TripAdvisor, Restoclub | 1.5x |
| **Beauty** | YCLIENTS integration | Yell.ru, Zoon | 1.3x |

### Implementation: "Otzovik for Clinics"

```
Effort: Medium
Timeline: 1-2 months per vertical

Tasks:

1. Landing page: otzovik.ai/clinics
   - Speak their language ("пациенты", not "клиенты")
   - Show clinic-specific case studies
   - Mention ProDoctorov, NaPopravku

2. Add platform integrations
   - Scrape/link to ProDoctorov
   - Track medical-specific review sites

3. Templates
   - SMS templates for medical context
   - AI response templates (HIPAA-like sensitivity)

4. Integrations
   - Clinic CRMs: IDENT, 1C:Медицина, Medesk

5. Pricing
   - "Otzovik Клиника": 7,990₽/mo (vs 4,990₽ generic)
```

### Economics

```
Generic approach:
1000 customers × 3,500₽ = 3.5M₽ MRR

Vertical approach (3 niches):
300 clinics × 7,000₽ = 2.1M₽
300 auto × 5,000₽ = 1.5M₽
300 beauty × 4,000₽ = 1.2M₽
Total: 4.8M₽ MRR

Same total customers, +37% revenue
```

### Risks

- Smaller addressable market per vertical
- Need to understand each industry
- Marketing costs multiply (separate campaigns)
- Can't be expert in everything

## 9. Growth Roadmap

### When to Do What

| Stage | Customers | Focus | Expected Impact |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Now** | 0-100 | Core product, find PMF | Validate idea |
| **100+** | 100-300 | Add monitoring + alerts | +50% ARPU |
| **300+** | 300-500 | Pick 1 vertical, go deep | +30% ARPU |
| **500+** | 500-1000 | White-label for agencies | +500k₽ MRR |
| **1000+** | 1000+ | Expand to Kazakhstan | +50% market |

### Projected Ceiling

| Expansion | Added MRR | Cumulative |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Base Russia | 3M₽ | 3M₽ |
| + Monitoring/AI | +1.5M₽ | 4.5M₽ |
| + Verticals | +1M₽ | 5.5M₽ |
| + White-label | +1M₽ | 6.5M₽ |
| + CIS | +2.5M₽ | 9M₽ |

**Maximum realistic ceiling: 8-10M₽ MRR (100-120M₽ ARR)**

### Exit Valuation

| ARR | Multiple | Exit Value |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 20M₽ | 2-3x | 40-60M₽ |
| 50M₽ | 2-3x | 100-150M₽ |
| 100M₽ | 2.5-3x | 250-300M₽ |

Small SaaS in Russia typically sells for 2-3x ARR to strategic buyers (competitors, agencies, holding companies).

---

## 10. Bottom Line

### The Honest Assessment

This is a **valid 1-3M₽/year profit business** with realistic effort:

- Not a moonshot
- Good first SaaS to learn on
- Can sell for 10-30M₽ in 2-3 years if grown well
- With full expansion: 100M₽+ ARR possible but requires 3-5 years

### Success Criteria

| Metric | "Good" | "Great" | "Exceptional" |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 12-month customers | 100 | 200 | 400 |
| 12-month MRR | 300k₽ | 600k₽ | 1.2M₽ |
| 24-month customers | 300 | 600 | 1,200 |
| 24-month MRR | 1M₽ | 2M₽ | 4M₽ |

### Final Advice

Build it if the journey interests you, not just the destination.

The best outcome isn't the money — it's learning how to:
- Build a product people pay for
- Acquire customers profitably
- Retain and grow accounts
- Eventually sell or automate

These skills transfer to any future venture.
