   - Future: AI auto-suggest responses to negative reviews that slip through to Yandex/2GIS

4. **No review monitoring** - We generate, do not aggregate
   - Future: Add passive monitoring from Yandex/2GIS

5. **No QR codes** - Revvy has them for tables/receipts
   - Future: Generate QR to review page (easy add)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Segments (Priority Order):

5. **Fitness studios** - YCLIENTS users, monthly members

### Positioning:

> "SMS работает везде. WhatsApp — нет. Ваши клиенты получат сообщение."

**Secondary message (value):**
> "Сбор отзывов для Яндекс Карт и 2ГИС. От 1,090₽/месяц."

**Against competitors:**
> "Пока конкуренты ждут разблокировки WhatsApp, ваши клиенты уже оставляют отзывы."

### Channels:

1. **SEO:** Target keywords like "collect reviews yandex maps", "get reviews 2gis"
